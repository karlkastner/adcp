adcp : processing of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data

Processing in 3 Levels:

Level 0 : Read in of raw-data (externally provided by ADCPtools, Vermeulen et al.)

Level 1 : VADCP, HADCP, SPADCP
	- convert raw data to CI units (m,s,kg)
	- transform velocities to arbitrary coordinate references
	- depth averaging and integration
	- fit velocity profiles
	- convert backscatter to suspended sediment concentration

Level 2 : CrossSection
	- interpolate and integrate for cross sections

Instruction:
	see and run saggau/sanggau_process_discharge for a working example
	to process VADCP discharge at a non-tidal station
