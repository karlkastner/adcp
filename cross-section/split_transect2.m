devide and conquer
	split if sum(abs(traveldist)) > sum(traveldist)
	split at furthest point
	for each part split again
	% terminate if distance to furthest point is less than 3/4 of the transect width
	or if the length of one half remains zero (this does not actually splits all transects)

	sum(dx)-abs(sum(dx)) = 0
